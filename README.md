# Silent Failure in HTML: Modifying innerHTML of a Non-Existent Element

This repository demonstrates a subtle bug in HTML/JavaScript where attempting to modify the `innerHTML` property of an element that hasn't been rendered yet will not throw an error but simply fail silently.

The `bug.html` file shows the problematic code. The `bugSolution.html` file provides a corrected version.

This type of error is particularly hard to debug, as no error messages are generated, and it is easy to overlook the missing element in the HTML structure.
